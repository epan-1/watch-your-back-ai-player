Program Structure

AI Strategies/Design Approach
- Split the game into its 2 major phases with different algorithms for deciding moves based on which phase the game was currently in

- Our strategy revolves around the centre squares
- They are the most powerful as time goes on due to the board shinking

Place:
- Current placing phase considerations:
	- If 1 place will eliminate a piece
	- Blacklists suicide tiles 
	- Else, Defends a piece that has been advanced upon
	- Else, places at a random valid tile, starting from the centre

Move:
- Current moving phase considerations for 1 'move':
	- If 1 move will eliminate a piece
    - Else, move pieces towards the centre from the outermost pieces
    - Else, do a random valid move

- Each move uses a search tree and an evaluation function to find the best possible move

- Our evaluation function takes into account:
	- The number of our minus enemy pieces
	- Pieces that are set up to take enemy pieces
	- Total distance between our pieces and enemy pieces
- This makes our player agressive, but smart
- Movement phase also had algorithms to consider board shrinkage and its effect on pieces and corresponding strategies

- Strategies for placing phase
    - Machine Learning for choosing optimal positions for placement with the scoring function to maximise player's while eliminating as many of
      the enemies pieces as possible
